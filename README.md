# Fitness Tracker

This project was generated with Angular 16. Angular, Angular Material, and Firebase are used to make an awesome responsive web app to track fitness exercises for everyone. Many features are used like authentication, lazy-loaded modules, guards, Firestore and so many others. This is a real authenticated app. Each user has its own data field in the database Firestore. Reactive forms are used with error messages in all possible cases even in no-connection cases. You can try the fitness tracker yourself at https://ng-fitness-b2e70.web.app/
